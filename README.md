### Git

We use conventional commits. For more information you can check out the [Conventional Commit Homepage](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

We follow a development branch naming convention: `<work type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`

1. Start clasifying by work type. Examples: bugfix, feature, rebase, hotfix, docs, release, refactor.
2. Use dashes - to separate words.
3. Include related issue number (if any).
4. Describe the topic using two or three words.
